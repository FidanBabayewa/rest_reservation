						Lankaran’s local cuisine is rich and diverse: rice, meat, fish, vegetables and mouth-watering
						sweets are staples of this region in the subtropical south spread between the Talysh Mountains
						and the Caspian Sea. The area is diverse and multicultural, with the large Talysh population
						giving their own interesting twist to traditional Azerbaijani cuisine. The most famous local
						dish is lavangi, which is made of chicken or fish stuffed with nuts, onions and sumakh and
						cooked in the cylindrical clay tandir oven traditionally used to bake delicious tandir bread.
						Other dishes worth trying are kulcha, local lentil and pumpkin pilafs and turshu kebab.
						Vegetarians should check out kükü, an omelette filled with onions and herbs and served with
						soft, thin lavash flatbread.
